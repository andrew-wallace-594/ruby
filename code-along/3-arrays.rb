# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 3-arrays.rb

# Arrays are lists of things

# favortite_foods = [
#     "tacos", "pizza", "ice cream"]
#     puts favortite_foods

# we_have_to_go_back = [4,8,15,16,23,42]
# puts we_have_to_go_back

# Accessing the array

mixed_array = ["tacos", 3 , true]
puts mixed_array


# Add to the array
